**Notational sampling (active pitches):**

Events come from ``music21`` ``flatten().notes`` (``Note`` and ``Chord`` only). A component is **active**
in a window if its **notated** span overlaps the window: ``onset < window_end`` and
``onset + quarterLength > window_start`` (sustained soundings count without an attack inside the window).
Chord members contribute as separate MIDI heights before optional collapse. All parts are merged via
``flatten()`` into one aggregate list.

**pitch_sampling_mode**

* ``event_instances`` — every in-register MIDI contribution is kept (cross-part unisons and repeated
  noteheads count separately).
* ``unique_pitch_heights`` — collapse to distinct MIDI pitch numbers inside the window before span,
  pairwise distance, and occupancy entropy.

**Ties:** ``tie_policy=as_imported`` (default) preserves importer structure; ``merge_ties`` runs
``stripTies()`` before listing. Each overlapping ``Note``/``Chord`` object contributes according to the
rules above.

**Edge-case convention (all window metrics):**

* **No active pitches** in the window: ``dispersion_degree``, ``registral_span``,
  ``mean_pairwise_registral_distance``, ``registral_centroid``, ``registral_std``, and ``occupancy_entropy`` are
  **NaN**; ``active_note_count`` is 0; ``min_pitch`` / ``max_pitch`` are **NaN**. The secondary
  ``normalized_dispersion_degree`` and other ``normalized_*`` fields are **NaN** in the same windows.
* **Exactly one active pitch**: ``dispersion_degree`` = 0, ``registral_span`` = 0,
  ``mean_pairwise_registral_distance`` = 0 (no pairs),
  ``registral_centroid`` = that pitch, ``registral_std`` = 0, ``occupancy_entropy`` = 0 (single-bin occupancy);
  ``min_pitch`` = ``max_pitch`` = that pitch. Normalized dispersion fields are 0; ``normalized_registral_centroid``
  is ``(pitch - register_low) / R``.

**Terminology:** ``dispersion_degree`` is the **canonical** registral dispersion metric
(``max(pitches) - min(pitches)`` in semitones; numerically identical to ``registral_span``).
``mean_pairwise_registral_distance`` is a **supplementary** descriptor when clustering is uneven.
``registral_centroid`` and ``registral_std`` summarize **tessitura location** and **cluster tightness** (complementary
to span/pairwise; raw centroid is **not** transposition-invariant). ``occupancy_entropy`` is **not** registral dispersion;
it is a legacy **register-uniformity / occupancy-evenness** recipe retained for comparison. This tool does **not** infer density, harmony, pitch-class set structure,
tessitura labels, acoustic brightness, or orchestration.
